*** Modify the 'Input Manager' ***
You can also use 'Xbox360 controller' by customizing the "Input Manager" settings.

In order to copy and paste the files, use your File Browser such as 'Explorer' and 'Finder'.

    You can find a ZIP-file named "InputManager.zip" in the 'ReadMe[Ver.##]' folder.
    'Your project name' >> 'Assets' >> 'Physics_Tank_Maker'  >> 'ReadMe[Ver.##]'
    Unzip the "InputManager.zip" and copy the "InputManager.asset".
   

(2) Paste the "InputManager.asset" into the 'ProjectSettings' folder.
    'Your project name' >> 'ProjectSettings'
    You can find the current "InputManager.asset" in the 'ProjectSettings' folder.
    Paste the new "InputManager.asset" and overwrite it.
   


(3) Confirm that the "Input Manager" has been updated.
    Edit >> Project Settings >> Input
    If it was successful, you can find new Axes "Horizontal2", "Vertical2", "L_Button", "R_Button", "L_Trigger", "R_Trigger" in the Inspector window.
