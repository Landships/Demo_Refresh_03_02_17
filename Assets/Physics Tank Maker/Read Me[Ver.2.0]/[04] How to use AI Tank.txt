(Warning.)
This AI system requires Navigation Meshes (NavMesh) in the scene.
When the NavMesh has not been baked for the scene, you will get errors in PlayMode.
In sample scenes, the NavMeshes are already prepared.

You can find finished AI tank prefabs in the "Resources" >> "Sample_Tank_##" >> "AI_##" folder.


(1) Drag and drop the prefab into the Hierarchy window.
   
(2) Select the top object of the tank in the Hierarchy window.

(3) Choose the "Tank ID" differing from other tanks in the Inspector window.
   
    (Notice.) You can skip this step.

(4) Choose the "Relationship".
    Choose the relationship with other tanks.
   

(5) Set the "WayPoint Pack" fitting for the scene.
   
   
    Drag and drop the "WayPoint Pack" fitting for the scene.
    (Notice.)
    When the WayPoint Pack is not assigned, the AI tank tries to stay in its initial position.
    
    'WayPoint Pack' has some child gameobjects as waypoints.
   

(6) Select the top object of the tank, and adjust the position as you will.
   

(7) Now you are ready to play.
    (Notice.) You can modify the AI settings much more.
    Please also read the reference text "Top object of the tank" and "AI_System".
